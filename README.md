# Telegram-Bot-
A small telegram bot for remembering notes, pictures, documents, phones whatever. Just a small notebook.
I use it for a year and I found it very useful. 

---

This version is maintained for Python 3.x but it actually 
should be working OK for 2.7.x

uses telegram API:
```
pip install python-telegram-bot

```





What you need to do:

1. Create a bot with telegram bot father
2. Copy the secret code you got from the bot father into secret.txt
3. Edit users.txt - don't forget to set yourself as admin
4. Create a folder for the notes. I have it on my disk synchronized  with Google drive. Just in case.
5. Move users.txt, help.txt and secret.txt to that folder.
6. Start the bot with paramter : the message folder name:

``` 
python telegram_bot.py  "x:/Google Drive/MyBotFolder/"
```
