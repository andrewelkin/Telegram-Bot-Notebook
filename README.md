# Telegram-Bot-
A small telegram bot for remembering notes, pictures, documents, phones whatever. Just a small notebook.
I use it for a year and I found it very useful.

What you need to do:

1. Create a bot with telegram bot father
2. Copy the secret code you got from the bot father into secret.txt
3. Edit users.txt - don't forget to set yourself as admin
4. Create a folder for the notes. I have it on my disk synchronized  with Google drive. Just in case.
5. Move users.txt, help.txt and secret.txt to that folder.
6. Start the bot
